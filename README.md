## ⚙️ How It Works
- Choose how many rounds you want to play.  
- The computer secretly picks a random number between 1 and 100.  
- You guess until you get it right — the fewer attempts you take, the better your score.  
- Each correct guess earns you **10 points**.
- The game tracks your performance and grades you as:
  - 🥇 **Master Guesser** (1–3 total attempts)
  - 😐 **Average Guesser** (4–9 attempts)
  - 🤡 **Noob Guesser** (10+ attempts)

You can quit anytime by typing **"quit"**.
